**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Initial targets of <500ms for AI operations were unrealistic.

**Decision**: Establish realistic performance targets based on actual AI processing times.

**Rationale**:
- AI model inference takes 10-30 seconds for complex layouts
- Document OCR can take 1-2 minutes
- Setting realistic expectations improves user experience
- Allows proper progress indicators and user feedback

**New Targets**:
- Simple queries: <2s (project metadata, basic queries)
- AI layout generation: <30s (with progress indicators)
- Document OCR processing: <2min (with progress indicators)
- Building code validation: <10s

**Implementation**:
- Comprehensive progress indicators
- Background processing with WebSocket updates
- User-friendly waiting experiences
- Proper timeout handling and recovery

## ADR-004: Multi-Language AI Model Selection

**Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Initial design used fixed AI models without considering language and regional differences.

**Decision**: Implement dynamic AI model selection based on language, region, and document type.

**Rationale**:
- Different AI models have different language capabilities
- Regional building codes require specialized processing
- Cost optimization through appropriate model selection
- Better accuracy for non-English documents

**Selection Criteria**:
- Language: Turkish, English, German, French, Spanish
- Document type: Building codes, technical drawings, user prompts
- Complexity: Simple vs complex architectural tasks
- Cost: Balance between accuracy and cost

**Implementation**:
- ModelSelector service in Python
- Language detection pipeline
- Fallback model hierarchy
- Cost and performance monitoring

## ADR-005: Project Versioning and Change Tracking

**Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to track all AI operations and enable rollback capabilities.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive project versioning with AI operation tracking.

**Rationale**:
- Architects need to see evolution of AI suggestions
- Rollback capability for failed AI operations
- Audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Learning from human corrections

**Features**:
- Version created before/after each AI operation
- Element-level change tracking
- Human review and correction tracking
- Export of project evolution timeline
- Rollback to any previous state

**Implementation**:
- ProjectVersionManager in C#
- SQLite database for version storage
- Element snapshot and diff capabilities
- UI for viewing version history

## ADR-006: Mandatory Human Review for All AI Outputs

**Date**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to ensure AI outputs are always validated by human architects.

**Decision**: All AI outputs must require human review and explicit approval before execution.

**Rationale**:
- Professional responsibility and liability
- AI models can make errors or misunderstand requirements
- Building code compliance requires human judgment
- Maintains architect control over design decisions

**Implementation**:
- HumanReviewWorkflow service
- ReviewQueue for pending approvals
- Comprehensive validation UI
- Feedback collection for AI improvement
- Audit trail of all human decisions
