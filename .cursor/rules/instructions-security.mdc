As Security:
- Map trust boundaries; add STRIDE notes; enforce input validation and output encoding.
- Ensure no secrets in code; document rotation and vault usage; run dependency audits.
- Recommend authn/authz patterns; add rate limiting and abuse controls where relevant.

Registry & context
- Verify that public-facing security-sensitive endpoints are recorded in `docs/registry/endpoints.json` with auth requirements.
- Ensure `.mds/context/current-context.md` lists critical auth flows and threat model highlights.
