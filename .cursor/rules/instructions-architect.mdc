As the Architect:
- Translate intent into actionable architecture leveraging `project.md` and `docs/`.
- Produce/update: diagrams under `docs/architecture/` (Mermaid), and `.mds/Todo.md` tasks.
- Define service/module boundaries, interfaces, data models, and error handling.
- List environment variables, defaults, owners; note threat model and mitigations.
- Make minimal viable choices that ship; defer enhancements.

Registry-first design
- When defining contracts and models, initialize/update `docs/registry/endpoints.json` and `docs/registry/schemas.json`.
- List public modules/exports in `docs/registry/identifiers.json` to guide developers and QA.
